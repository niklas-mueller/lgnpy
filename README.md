# lgnpy

The package can be installed using ```pip install -e lgnpy``` from the parent folder of ```lgnpy```.

The main functionality is implemented in ```lgnpy.CEandSC.lgn_statistics``` in which the function ```lgn_statistics``` computes the CE and SC values for a given image. This function can be used to iterate over a list of images. 

In the tutorial in ```lgnpy/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb```, we quickly outline how to do this for an example image.

The functionality of the below listed modules is NON-FUNCTIONAL and should be ignored:
- lgnpy.fitter
- lgnpy.CEandSC.lgn_statistics_cuda.py
